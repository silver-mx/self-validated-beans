# self-validated-beans

This project experiments with the idea of self validated beans in Java by making use of [Hibernate Validator](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/8.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#_validating_constraints). The idea is to execute all the [Jakarta Bean Validation Constraints](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#validator-defineconstraints-spec) when an instance is created.
